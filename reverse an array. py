#reverse an array using reverse() method
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
arr.reverse()
print(arr)

#reverse an array using slicing
arr = arr[::-1] 
print(arr)

#reverse an array using loop
new_arr = []
for i in range(len(arr)-1,-1,-1):
    new_arr.append(arr[i])
print(new_arr)

'''Which is Most Efficient?
If you want to modify the original array:

Use the reverse() method. It is the most space-efficient and simple.

If you want to keep the original array unchanged:

Use slicing ([::-1]). It is simple and concise, though it uses extra space.

If you want explicit control or need to perform additional operations while reversing:

Use the loop method. It is more flexible but slightly more verbose.

Practical Recommendation:
Use reverse() if you donâ€™t need the original array.

Use slicing if you need a new reversed array and want concise code.

Use a loop if you need more control or are performing additional operations during the reversal'''
